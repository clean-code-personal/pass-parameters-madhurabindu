# Passing parameters

This assignment has some bad ways of passing around parameters.

Make improvements in the code, keeping in mind the following (in order of priority):
1. _Readability_: To make it quick for a maintainer to read the code
1. _Efficiency_: To avoid using more memory or cycles than needed
1. _Single source_ of truth: To avoid modifying in multiple places to change behavior 
1. _Re-usability_: To avoid re-coding the same functionality
